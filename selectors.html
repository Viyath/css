        <h1>What are CSS Selectors</h1>
        <h3>Selectors are based on few attributes such as</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Element Name</li>
                <p>By using p eliment all the paras will be affected!</p>
            <li>id</li>
                <p id="para1">There should be unique IDs within the page. Through these id we can identify elements and style them</p>
            <li>class</li>
                <p class="paraclass">The idea of the class is to have more attributes with same kind of styling. To have class just specify
                    class="name for the calss" in html and in css file just use .followed by the class name</p>
            <li>attributes</li>
        </ul>
